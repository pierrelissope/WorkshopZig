# Workshop 13 - Introduction to Zig

Welcome to this introductory workshop on Zig! Zig is a modern programming language that emphasizes robustness, performance and clarity. Today, you'll learn how to install Zig, create your first project, and discover the language's key concepts by creating a palindrome detection program.

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming skills (C, C++, or any other language)
- A computer with Internet access

## Workshop objectives

- Install Zig on your machine
- Initialize a Zig project
- Understand the basics of the Zig language
- Create a palindrome detection program

## Step 0 - SETUP

All the required information to install dependencies can be found in [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md).

> 💡 We recommend you to follow the [Getting started](https://ziglang.org/learn/getting-started/) for this workshop.

### Step 1 - Hello World! in Zig

> ❗ We strongly advise you to use the resources given for this exercise.

For the first exercise, we simply ask you to write `Hello world!` in your terminal when you run your program.

To do this, create a file `main.zig` in a folder called `src`.


> 💡 Zig file has `zig` extension.

> 💡 Now, that you have created a file `main.zig`, you can use other files. To use them in your `main.zig` you have to integrate the module ([read more](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71186556/how-do-i-include-one-zig-file-from-another-zig-file))
