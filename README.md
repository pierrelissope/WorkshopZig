# Introduction to Zig

### Step 1 - Hello World! in Zig

> ❗ We strongly advise you to use the resources given for this exercise.

For the first exercise, we simply ask you to write `Hello world!` in your terminal when you run your program.

To do this, create a file `main.zig` in a folder called `src`.


> 💡 Zig file has `zig` extension.

> 💡 Now, that you have created a file `main.zig`, you can use other files. To use them in your `main.zig` you have to integrate the module ([read more](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71186556/how-do-i-include-one-zig-file-from-another-zig-file))
